; start with the identity pattern

; for the NEXT uninitialized argument of the current pattern stream
; TREE (arg can be on any ps leaf)

;   1. based upon the ps's current INITIALIZED args, simplify the
;   ps's sequence

;   pattern looks at the sequence, suggest arguments for current ps
;   node's pattern, based upon the sequence's "characteristics",
;   returning only those arguments that are under the specified
;   confidence threshold; each candidate sub-pattern must be asked to
;   provide a confidence score, based upon the simplified sequence it
;   is passed

;   for each SUGGESTED ARG:

;      2. set the uninitialized arg to the suggested ps arg, and sett ITS
;      seq to the simplified seq from step 1.
;
;      3. copy the entire ps tree and enqueue it


; simplify sequence, given partially initialized arg list

; for the next uninit'd ps arg, query each candidate pattern for a
; confidence score, given the simplified seq (the pattern looks at
; *only* the simplified seq and determines if it is "applicable" to
; the sequence)
